  - There is no reference corresponding to this package so I have not included
    any link in the `DESCRIPTION` file.
    
  - I was asked to remove the `LICENSE` files, but I would prefer to retain
    them. A lot of users explore the package on `GitHub` and it would better to
    have this file front and center in the home directory. This is a practice I
    have followed in all of my other packages on `CRAN` and I have not been
    asked to remove them.
    
  - I have added `value` section to `.Rd` files for exported functions.
