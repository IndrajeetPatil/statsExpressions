\usage{
expr_t_parametric(
  data,
  x,
  y,
  paired = FALSE,
  effsize.type = "g",
  conf.level = 0.95,
  var.equal = FALSE,
  k = 2,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe (or a tibble) from which variables specified are to
be taken. A matrix or tables will \strong{not} be accepted.}

\item{x}{The grouping variable from the dataframe \code{data}.}

\item{y}{The response (a.k.a. outcome or dependent) variable from the
dataframe \code{data}.}

\item{paired}{Logical that decides whether the experimental design is
repeated measures/within-subjects or between-subjects. The default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{effsize.type}{Type of effect size needed for \emph{parametric} tests. The
argument can be \code{"biased"} (\code{"d"} for Cohen's \emph{d}) or \code{"unbiased"}
(\code{"g"} Hedge's \emph{g} for \strong{t-test}). The default is \code{"g"}.}

\item{conf.level}{Scalar between 0 and 1. If unspecified, the defaults return
\verb{95\%} lower and upper confidence intervals (\code{0.95}).}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the
    variances in the samples as equal.  If \code{TRUE}, then a simple F
    test for the equality of means in a one-way analysis of variance is
    performed.  If \code{FALSE}, an approximate method of Welch (1951)
    is used, which generalizes the commonly known 2-sample Welch test to
    the case of arbitrarily many samples.}

\item{k}{Number of digits after decimal point (should be an integer)
(Default: \code{k = 2}).}

\item{stat.title}{A character describing the test being run, which will be
added as a prefix in the subtitle. The default is \code{NULL}. An example of a
\code{stat.title} argument will be something like \code{"Student's t-test: "}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}

\details{
Cohen's \emph{d} is calculated in the traditional fashion as the
difference between means or mean minus \emph{mu} divided by the estimated
standardized deviation.  By default Hedge's correction is applied
(\emph{N}-3)/(\emph{N}-2.25) to produce \emph{g}. For independent samples \emph{t}-test, there
are two possibilities implemented. If the \emph{t}-test did not make a
homogeneity of variance assumption, (the Welch test), the variance term
will mirror the Welch test, otherwise a pooled and weighted estimate is
used. If a paired samples \emph{t}-test was requested, then effect size desired
is based on the standard deviation of the differences.

The computation of the confidence intervals defaults to a use of
non-central Student-\emph{t} distributions.

When computing confidence intervals the variance of the effect size \emph{d} or
\emph{g} is computed using the conversion formula reported in Cooper et al.
