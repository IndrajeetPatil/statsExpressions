The returned tibble data frame can contain some or all of the following columns (the exact columns will depend on the statistical test):

  - `statistic`: the numeric value of a statistic

  - `df`: the numeric value of a parameter being modeled (often degrees
    of freedom for the test)

  - `df.error` and `df`: relevant only if the statistic in question has
    two degrees of freedom (e.g. anova)

  - `p.value`: the two-sided *p*-value associated with the observed statistic
  
  - `method`: the name of the inferential statistical test

  - `estimate`: estimated value of the effect size

  - `conf.low`: lower bound for the effect size estimate

  - `conf.high`: upper bound for the effect size estimate
  
  - `conf.level`: width of the confidence interval
  
  - `conf.method`: method used to compute confidence interval
  
  - `conf.distribution`: statistical distribution for the effect
  
  - `effectsize`: the name of the effect size

  - `n.obs`: number of observations
  
  - `expression`: pre-formatted expression containing statistical details
