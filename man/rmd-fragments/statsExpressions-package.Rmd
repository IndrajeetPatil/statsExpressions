The `{statsExpressions}` package has two key aims: 

- to provide a consistent syntax to do statistical analysis with tidy data (in pipe-friendly manner),
- to provide statistical expressions (pre-formatted in-text statistical
results) for plotting functions.

Statistical packages exhibit substantial diversity in terms of their syntax and
expected input type. This can make it difficult to switch from one statistical
approach to another. For example, some functions expect vectors as inputs, while
others expect dataframes. Depending on whether it is a repeated measures design
or not, different functions might expect data to be in wide or long format. Some
functions can internally omit missing values, while other functions error in
their presence. Furthermore, if someone wishes to utilize the objects returned
by these packages downstream in their workflow, this is not straightforward
either because even functions from the same package can return a list, a matrix,
an array, a dataframe, etc., depending on the function.

This is where `{statsExpressions}` comes in: It can be thought of as a unified
portal through which most of the functionality in these underlying packages can
be accessed, with a simpler interface and no requirement to change data format.
